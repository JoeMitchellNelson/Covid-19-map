# Animated map of the spread of Covid-19
Joe Mitchell-Nelson and Joanne Sherrod

### Using this repo

You'll need R and preferrably Rstudio installed to use this repo. R is free and open-source. [You can find help install R and Rstudio here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/).

This repo contains R code to create an animated map of the spread of Covid-19, using data pulled from the [New York Times' public github repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

All of the R code is in the file main.R. One note is that **you'll need an API key from the US Census Bureau**. The Census isn't picky about who gets a key, but it may take a few hours for them to approve your request. [Request an API key here](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

The individual frames generated by the code are located in the `frames` folder. The current iteration of the map is saved as THE_MAP.gif. We plan to update this gif weekly (on Thursdays).

To change, add, or remove map captions, edit the file `titles.txt`.

### Why the Trump quotes?

To us, January and February's developments feel like they happened 12 years ago. Since then, the president's response to the Covid-19 epidemic has taken a number of turns, and it's easy to lose track.  We hope this short gif provides a brief history of Trump's public stances on Covid-19 in the context of the spread of the virus in the US.

Rather than provide a cumulative measure of cases and deaths, we display a rolling total of cases and deaths in the previous two weeks. Cumulative measures can only increase or remain flat. As time passes, we hope that future updates show the virus receding.

### Sources

Demographic data come from the US Census Bureau. Data on confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths come from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). We gathered data on Trump's golf schedule from [Trumpgolfcount.com](https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayoutings). A list of Trump's campaign rallies can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_post-election_Donald_Trump_rallies).
